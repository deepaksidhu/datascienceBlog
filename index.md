Teens these days are swarmed up with too much information they see on different medias. Often these information influences and makes up the norm of how they think and process situations.  As a consequence of too much information overload, they usually struggle to pick one option out of many good and bad alternatives. Most of their instincts in decision making are influenced by the choices made by their closest friends. But even with this, the choices made by the closest friends are quite varying and diverse. Leaving the teens with the dilemma of having no clue what to pick? This blog post will inform teens on how to make better and confident choices based on the data science concept of ensemble methods for classification. They will feel more in control and assured of the future choices they will make, and reduce the indecisiveness they experience.

Often you are presented with a lot of options, for instance your alarm wakes you up in the morning, you are immediately presented with the choice of whether to sleep more or to get up and get ready for school. Another common situation could be you are in school, and you could either skip class or not (I advise you not to). When you get back home, you can either decide to do your homework and study or play your favorite computer game, which is definitely more exciting. Just based on these few examples, you are presented with choices at every turn. It is often a hard task to deliberate all the options and choose the one that is best for you.

The idea of the data science concept, ensemble, actually helps you make the best possible decision for your purposes. I know I am speaking of some technical jargon with the use of the word ensemble, and what does it mean to be best possible option? 

Consider the situation when you're family is going for a picnic, there is going to be a collection of different preferences for each family member for the destination to go. For an example you might want to go to an amusement park, but your parents prefers to have the picnic by the river. Another trivial example is, the choice of movie you and your group of friends will go and watch. Again in this examples there is going to be difference in informed opinions of which movie to watch, for you and each of your friends. The scenarios provided and other situations in which you have to make informed choices is where the concept of ensemble helps. In general you can consider ensemble just to  mean collection of informed choices based on a particular scenario. How does the idea of best option comes to play with the concept of an ensemble? Since each ensemble is made up of a collection of informed choices, the majority number based on this choices is going to be the best option. This is the option that you will result in less regrets and maximum satisfaction.


In order to understand this concept better, I will talk about one of the prevelant dilemmas among teens these days, which is when they are confronted with the decision of choosing whether to buy a *Playstation 5* or *XBOX X*.

Teens these days are extremely confused on whether they should avail a Playstation 5 or Xbox X. Most of them will do their research, compare the specifications and look at video reviews, but still have a hard time of coming up up with a conclusive decision. Often when they are torn with the options, they would ask the opinion of their friends but the group of friends have a varying degree of preferences, which makes the matter worse.

These kind of delimma that teens of today face, can be dealt with the idea of ensemble methods for classification. The way this data science concept work in this situation is that, the teen should consider a group(ensemble) of their closest friends whose opinion they value, preferably they should choose an odd number of friends. In this approach, it is important to consider that each of the friends are unique individuals, whose thinking process has been influenced by a variety of factors such as, upbringing, ethnicity, social condition, family composition and others. It is important to stress here that the choice (playstation vs xbox) made by the friend has been influenced by the factors mentioned above. In this setting each friend is a considered as separate unit wih informed thought process and mechanism to decide. The question now is, how can a teen choose with this collection of input from their friends?


Imagine a situation when teacher ask the class on whether the quiz should be open book or not? The teacher does the survey of yes and no's and finds out that the majoirity of the class opinion is that the quiz should be open-book. This is the idea behind how the ensemble method facilitate decision making for a particular situation. For the gaming platform question, once the preferences of the friends have been collected, this collection of choices is what we call an ensemble. Now that we have the ensemble of choices we carry out the majority vote counting principle. The most voted option is considered to be the best choice of gaming platform for the kid. Choosing an odd number of friends, helps assure that we don't have any tie breakers and we get the best option. Question now is, why is the choice suggested by the ensemble method the most likely choice, rather than the teen just going with their gut feeling?

To get an idea of why considering an ensemble of choices works better than just going with your own particular choice consider the graphic below. The check marks(✅) on the graphic corresponds to the ideal choice of platform, while the cross mark(❌) corresponds to the wrong choice of platform.

| Example | Friend 1    | Friend 2   |  Friend 3  | Ensemble |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------------|
|  1     | ✅    |   ✅    | ❌     | ✅✅❌=>✅  |
|  2     | ✅    |   ❌    | ✅     | ✅❌✅=>✅  |
|  3     | ❌    |   ✅    | ✅     | ❌✅✅=>✅  |

We can see from the graphic that If we only consider the opinion of one our friend, or more so just our own opinion we are likely to make a mistake. But if we consider the collection of opinions and do majority voting we reduce the chances of making a mistake for which platform to purchase. This is based on the hypothetical that we know what the ideal platform of choice is, represented by the check mark. More over the idea of ensemble works well, if the opinion of our friends are distinct enough.

**Conclusion:**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea for  making choices based on an ensemble method of classification can be extend to other choices that you are having a difficult time deliberating on. These approach will help you make better informed choices and decisions. Furhtermore, once you go and study data science you will appreciate it and will have a head start compared to others.
